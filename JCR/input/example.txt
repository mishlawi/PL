Y'all might as well get the music ready \bc this finna' take a while
Umm, When I had my accident I found out at that moment nothing in life is promised \expt death,
If \u had the \opp to play this game of life
\u need to appreciate every moment
a lot of people don't appreciate their moment until it's passed
And then, \u got to tell those Al Bundy stories "\u remember when I ?"
But, Right now is my time and my moment thanks to the fans, thanks to the accident, thanks to god, thanks to Roc-A-Fella, Jay-Z, Dame Dash, G, my mother, Rhymefest everyone that's helped me
And I plan to celebrate, I plan to celebrate and scream and pop champagne every chance I get \bc i'm at the grammys baby!
I know everybody's asking the question, they wanted know "I know he's going to wild out, I know he's going to do something \crzy"
Everbody wanted to know what I would do if I didn't win.
I guess we'll never know.
